	- maybe look to change method of averaging round stats to just tracking tournament stats
		- if the overall stats page is constantly updated

- label code
- player views
- sort by function for each column
- make the first column and header fixed as you scroll
- add some loading visual on the tournament input view

- login -> add team -> add players
- make sure each table is correct

- Move to Azure Cloud.
- Implement third party authentication.
- split database into a different file
