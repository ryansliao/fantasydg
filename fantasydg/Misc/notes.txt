- round stats are not matching with tournament stats (avg rounds vs. total)
	- maybe look to change method of averaging round stats to just tracking tournament stats
		- if the overall stats page is constantly updated

- implement tournament view and round view and use the tournament api pages

- Add database repository in models repo:
	- database functions, Create, update, insert
- Move to Azure Cloud.
- Implement third party authentication.
- split database into a different file
